Hello from the old template
<!---
section 'main-test-product' is duplicated here deliberately, so that we can see that both sections have the same content.
Making a change to one section in the live customizer will also apply the same changes to the other.
This is because using the section tag means that your sections are static.

{% section 'main-test-product' %}
{% section 'main-test-product' %}
